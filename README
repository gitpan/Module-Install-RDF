NAME
    Module::Install::RDF - advanced metadata for your distribution

SYNOPSIS
    In Makefile.PL:

      rdf_metadata;     # reads "meta/*"
      write_meta_ttl;   # writes "META.ttl"

DESCRIPTION
    This module doesn't really do much on its own, but is a pre-requisite
    for Module::Install::DOAP.

    Specifically, it reads all the RDF it can find in the distribution's
    "meta" directory and exposes it for other modules to make use of. It
    also allows you to write out a combined graph using Turtle.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
