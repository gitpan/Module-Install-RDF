NAME
    Module::Install::RDF - advanced metadata for your distribution

SYNOPSIS
    In Makefile.PL:

      rdf_metadata;

DESCRIPTION
    This module doesn't really do much on its own, but is a pre-requisite
    for Module::Install::DOAP.

    Specifically, it reads all the RDF it can find in the distribution's
    'meta' directory and exposes it for other modules to make use of.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
