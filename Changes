 - Use Object::ID::object_id instead of Scalar::Util::refaddr to uniquely
   identity Module::Install objects. (Though in a typical installation
   scenario, this shouldn't matter much.)
 - (Addition) rdf_project_uri function which provides heuristics to
   determine the URI of the primary doap:Project described in the meta
   directory.
